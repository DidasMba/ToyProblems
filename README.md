## Description

The `StudentGrade` function is designed to take a numerical input, check its validity, and assign a grade based on the input value. The grade is determined as follows:

- If the input is greater than 79, the grade is "A."
- If the input is between 60 and 79 (inclusive), the grade is "B."
- If the input is between 50 and 59 (inclusive), the grade is "C."
- If the input is between 40 and 49 (inclusive), the grade is "D."
- If the input is less than 40, the grade is "E."

The code ensures that the input is a valid number within the range of 0 to 100 and provides feedback if the input is invalid.

## Set Up Instructions

To use this code:

1. Ensure you have a JavaScript environment or a web browser with a developer console.
2. Copy the `StudentGrade` function from this repository.
3. Paste the function into your JavaScript environment or console.

Example usage:
```javascript
StudentGrade(40); // This will display "Student Grade: D" in the console.
