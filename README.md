### 1. Title

**ToyProblems: Student Grade Generator, Speed Detector, Net Salary Calculator**

### 2. Description

This repository contains JavaScript code solutions for three different toy problems:

1. **Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator**
    - This challenge prompts the user to input student marks between 0 and 100 and then calculates the corresponding grade based on specific grade ranges.

2. **Challenge 2: Speed Detector**
    - In this challenge, the program takes the speed of a car as input and determines whether the driver is within the speed limit. It also calculates demerit points based on the speed and checks if the driver's license should be suspended.

3. **Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator**
    - This challenge involves calculating an individual's net salary based on their basic salary and benefits. It calculates deductions for income tax, NHIF (National Hospital Insurance Fund), and NSSF (National Social Security Fund) as well as the gross salary and net salary.

### 3. Setup Instructions

To run the code for these challenges, follow these setup instructions:

**Challenge 1: Student Grade Generator**
1. Open `challenge1.js` in a web browser.
2. When prompted, enter the student's marks, and the program will display the corresponding grade.

**Challenge 2: Speed Detector**
3. Open `challenge2.js` in a web browser.
4. When prompted, enter the car's speed in kilometers per hour (km/h), and the program will determine whether it's within the speed limit and calculate demerit points if applicable.

**Challenge 3: Net Salary Calculator**
5. Open `challenge3.js` in a web browser.
6. When prompted, enter the basic salary and benefits for an individual.
7. The program will calculate and display the net salary based on placeholder tax rates and deductions. Replace these with the actual values as needed.
